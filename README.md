# SeqAlignBoost: High-Performance Local Sequence Alignment in DNA Analysis
Parallelizing the Smith-Waterman Algorithm for High-Performance Local Sequence Alignment in DNA Analysis

SeqAlignBoost is a project aimed at enhancing DNA analysis by parallelizing the Smith-Waterman algorithm using OpenMP. This repository contains the code for the parallel implementation, showcasing significant speed and efficiency improvements over traditional sequential implementations.

# Requirements #
Make sure you have the following software installed:

C/C++ compiler supporting OpenMP
OpenMP library

# Algorithm Description #
The Smith-Waterman algorithm is a widely used algorithm for local sequence alignment in DNA analysis. It helps identify regions of similarity between two DNA sequences, providing valuable insights into genetic patterns.

# Results #
The parallelized implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm using OpenMP demonstrates a significant reduction in execution time, as compared to traditional sequential implementations. For a 1200x1200 matrix implementation, the project showcased an impressive 78.5% reduction in execution time, making it highly effective in accelerating DNA analysis.
